# gl-shade-python
This source code implements the GL-SHADE algorithm presented in the paper "A SHADE-Based Algorithm for Large Scale Global Optimization" at the PPSN 2020 international conference. Here we present a non parallel implementation of GL-SHADE using python.

### gl-shade-cuda
Public interested in a parallel implementation of GL-SHADE using CUDA, you can visit https://github.com/delmoral313/gl-shade. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
In order to run the code, you need python 3 installed on your computer and the following python packages: 
- numpy 
- cec2013lsgo  

Documentation and steps for installing the cec2013lsgo package can be consulted here (https://pypi.org/project/cec2013lsgo/).

## Running the program 
For running the program you just need to type the following command on terminal:
- $ python3 glshade.py
